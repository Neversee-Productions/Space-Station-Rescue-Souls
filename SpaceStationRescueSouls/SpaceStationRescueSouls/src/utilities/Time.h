	/// Redefines the standard libraries chrono seconds template type to be the standard seconds ratio with counting type of float,
	/// this is because internally the standard library stores the duration in maximum precision and converts upwards utilising the two template arguments,
	/// first one being float and the second one being hidden as the standard ratio (defaults to std::ratio of 1i64 to 1i64) for a 64 bit integer to represent seconds.
